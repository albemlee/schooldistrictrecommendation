# Identifying At-Risk School Districts with Machine Learning

# Getting Started
To generate the files in the output folder, run the notebook files in the notebooks folder. They should be run in the following order:
1. Wrangling.ipynb: data preprocessing steps
2. Exploring.Rmd: exploratory data analysis
3. Clustering.ipynb: clustering models
4. Predicting.ipynb: machine learning (supervised learning models)
5. AutoML.ipynb: automated machine learning model (takes  over 12 hours to run)
6. Reports.Rmd: data, figures used in reports

Running all the notebooks will take over 24 hours. Alternatively, to generate just the key output files, run the data_analysis.py file.

# Documentation
The reports folder contains details about the project. Here is a description of each report:
- Proposal.docx: project proposal
- Milestone_Report.docx: milestone report
- final.pptx: final presentation slides

# Additional Information
- The helper.py file contains functions used by data_analysis.py and wrangling.py.
